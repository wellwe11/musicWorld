  Bio: {
    text: "This website was a personal project I built to get familiar with React and to apply the skills Iâ€™ve learned over the past year. I used the Ticketmaster API to fetch event data and Discogs to retrieve artist information. The idea for the project was inspired by my passion for music. I wanted to create something that combined both my technical knowledge and personal interests. It was a great way to explore real-world APIs, manage dynamic content, and build a user-friendly interface around a topic I truly enjoy.",
